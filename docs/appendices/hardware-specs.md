| Flash Memory         | 4 MB (varies by board)             |
| Wi-Fi                | 802.11 b/g/n/e/i                   |
| Bluetooth            | v4.2 BR/EDR and BLE                |
| UART                 | 3 UART interfaces                  |
| Operating Voltage    | 3.3 V                              |
| USB to Serial Chip   | CP2102 or CH340                    |

### Notes
- Ensure the board supports UART at â‰¥ 921600 baud for stable CSI output
- Most DevKit V1 boards come with CP2102 serial chip, which is reliable
